# Monolith Starter
The goal of this project is to make it a modern, lightweight sample application that makes use of the following:

- Spring Boot
- Maven (server-side dependency and building)
- NPM, Gulp, Bower (client-side dependency and building)
- Angular2
 - TypeScript generation w/ "compile-on-change" capability for development
- Auto-reload through Browser Sync
- One button build and deploy (for full app - server and client)

This sample project is heavily influenced by [Jhipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster).
